# Coins and Medals

The **Museum With No Frontiers — Coins and Medals** gallery: the gallery
collection with its dependent filters, a full-text database search, partner
profiles and their holdings, country timelines and the item sheets themselves —
built from the published dataset.

Unlike most MWNF galleries, Coins and Medals owns no content of its own: every
object is borrowed from another MWNF project, which is why each item sheet
names a source project and why the "search the related database" link is
absent on members from projects with no public database of their own.

A website is a light, static Vue 3 front-end for one published dataset. It
combines three `@museumwnf` packages from npmjs:

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `@museumwnf/coins-medals-data` | the dataset (JSON + `manifest.json`) |
| `@museumwnf/viewer-core` | application engine (routing, data access, the text runtime and the language service) |
| `@museumwnf/viewer-i18n` | the texts shared with the other MWNF websites (this one receives the `gallery` bundle: `core` + `layout` + `gallery`) |
| `@museumwnf/viewer-layout` | page structure (`PageShell` + sections), themed via `theme/tokens.css` |

Every one of these publishes publicly to npmjs, so `npm install` needs no
authentication anywhere — not in CI, not on a developer's own machine. Nothing
in this repository holds a token.

## What is where

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/dataset.config.js` | the whole website declaration: dataset package, languages, page shell, the route map |
| `src/SiteShell.vue` | the gallery chrome — header (logo, search, language switcher), banner, navigation, footer — wrapped around `PageShell` |
| `src/views/` | one component per page of the gallery |
| `src/components/` | the pieces shared between pages (object grid, pagination, banners, partner map) |
| `src/composables/` | data access over the package: gallery data, collection search, timeline, glossary |
| `locales/` | this gallery's own texts, editable by translators (see below) |
| `theme/` | the visual identity: `tokens.css`, `overrides.css`, `assets/` |

### Two layers, one merge rule

The texts every MWNF gallery shares — the menu, the item-sheet labels, the
editorial pages about searching and about the Partners — come from
[`viewer-i18n`](https://github.com/museumwithnofrontiers/viewer-i18n) as the `gallery`
bundle. `locales/` holds only what belongs to *this* gallery, and may overload
any shared entry by spelling out the same name: `gallery.about.body` is
overloaded there with the Coins and Medals text, while `coins.credits.body` is
a name of this gallery's own, because there is no generic credits page to
inherit.

The local file is applied last. **Local wins** — that is the only merge rule in
the system. A gallery cannot delete a shared entry; leaving it out means
inheriting it.

There used to be a second, vendored catalogue under `src/i18n/` and a
`useUiStrings.js` composable with its own language state beside viewer-core's.
Both are gone, and so is the hand-written code that kept the two languages in
step.

## Development

The preview runs in Docker; nothing needs to be installed on the host.

```bash
docker compose up
```

No npm login is needed: every `@museumwnf` package installs anonymously from
npmjs. Nothing in this repository holds a token. Then open
<http://localhost:5173>.

`npm run build`, `npm run test` and `npm run lint` are the three checks CI runs
(build and test are blocking).

## Translator — editing the website's texts

You only need a GitHub account and a browser. The files under `locales/` hold
**this gallery's own texts**, one file per language — `en.json` is English,
`fr.json` French, and so on.

Texts shared with the other MWNF galleries — the menu, the labels of an item
sheet, the page about how to search — are not here: they live in
[`viewer-i18n`](https://github.com/museumwithnofrontiers/viewer-i18n) and are edited there,
the same way. This gallery can override any of them by writing the same entry
name in its own file. The museum content itself arrives already translated in
the dataset and is not edited anywhere.

1. **Open the folder** `locales/` on this repository's GitHub page and click
   the language file you want to change.
2. **Click the pencil** (✏️, top right). Change only the text between the
   second pair of quotation marks on a line — the part before the colon is the
   name of the entry and must stay exactly as it is.
3. **To start a new language**, copy all of `en.json`, create a file named with
   the two-letter language code (e.g. `it.json`), paste and translate. A
   language does not have to be complete: anything untranslated shows in
   English.
4. **Click "Commit changes…" then "Propose changes".**
5. **Wait for the automatic check.** A green tick means your change goes live
   by itself a few minutes later. If something is off, a comment appears
   explaining in plain language what to fix.

A text is **just text**, formatted with Markdown if you want: `**bold**`,
`*italic*`, `[a link](https://example.org)`. It may not contain HTML tags, and
it may not contain `{` or `}` — nothing is ever inserted into a text, so a
number or a date is placed next to it by the website rather than inside it.

## Webdesigner — theming the website

The whole visual identity lives in `theme/`: `tokens.css` (colours, fonts,
spacing — the normal surface), `overrides.css` (escape hatch) and `assets/`.
Follow the same pencil-button flow as above for small changes, or run the
Docker preview for real design work. A change to a layout component itself is a
request for the `viewer-layout` package — open an issue there.

## Deployment

Every push to `main` builds and publishes the site to
<https://museumwithnofrontiers.github.io/coins-medals/> through the reusable workflows in
[`museumwithnofrontiers/viewer-workflows`](https://github.com/museumwithnofrontiers/viewer-workflows).
The base path comes from `BASE_PATH` at build time and defaults to the
repository name.
